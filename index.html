            <p>Hey there!  I'm Jared.  The pieces of paper that I paid colleges to receive would tell you that I am proficient in finance, operations management, and economics.  What does that mean?  Well, I invest as a hobby.  I tried to work for Merrill Lynch right out of undergrad but there was a great recession - you may have heard of it.  The numbers speak to me.  A definitive way to look at information and patterns.  And what about the Master's in Operations Management?  Well, that just means that I can breakdown a project into small digestible pieces.</p>

            <p>Are you still reading this?  Ok, so more about me.  I like dogs, dark chocolate, and a good pizza but not all at the same time.  I am taking web development for a lot of reasons but principal among them is so I can build a user inferface to test a business idea.  Since I have several years of "real world" work experience, I also want to diversify my skillset.  I have seen first hand the consumer goods industry shift to a more digital first environment.  If people that sell chips and soda are saying 'we have to go digital' then I think it will be table stakes in the years ahead across many industries.</p>
